////This will be a running list of questions that come up. The goal is to decide which option is the better choice for each question.

1) Is it better to cast data types in the ViewModel as needed or should the Model class contain a calculated variable for each data type needed?
    - For example, to calculate a total sale you need a price (Double) and a quantity (Integer). Should you, A. make the quantity a Double even though it will only ever be whole numbers, B. add a calculated variable called 'quantityAsDouble' to the model that returns the quantity casted as an Integer, or C. cast the quantity as an Integer as needed in the View Model?
    
2) For Realm, can I add all realm functions as static functions in a separate class and call as needed or will it slow performance?
