I changed from storing all logic in the LazySplitViewModel to using a singleton LazyNavService. LazySplitViewModel subscribes to the LazyNavService with Combine. Lazy split view then receives notifications when the view changes so it knows when to hide the menu.

There's a bit of lag when opening closing the menu in Index, but it might be because of the Async/Await RealmActor

From SettingsView, using LazySplitService.pushView will add a view to the detail, but won't remove it after tapping back.

Incorrect technique: When the inner split view detail contains a NavigationStack with an EmptyView as the root, using a button from the SettingsView to push a view onto detailPath results in the detail being pushed into the second stack position and therefore shows the back button. The path never fully clears though and will result in one view being appended the first time, two views being appended the second time, etc.

Correct technique: The inner split view should have an empty NavigationStack. From views that appear besideDetail, like SettingsView, use a NavigationLink to place the destination in the detail column.
    - If the detail is empty and a Button using LazySplitService.pushView(to detail) is tapped, the view won't appear in the detail column. This is okay. Buttons should only be used to push views onto the main stack*?
After tapping a NavigationLink(value:label:), the view will appear in the detail column. That detailView can contain more navigationLinks and navigationDestinations. Tapping these links will push views onto to detail column like a navigationStack

On iPad orientation change, if the detail column has a detail view, the views in the navigationStack are lost. Probably from re-initialization resulting from style change.
