# Version 0.1 to 0.4
The first version was intended to only be used by my family's business through TestFlight. 'Completeness' was not a requirement because I knew exactly which pages they would use. Re-usability was not a question, nor was responsive design. I knew exactly what the departments would be and exactly what device it would be used on. Because of this, Version0.1 was created with many static/hard-coded variables and values. It now acts as the baseline project for Invex.

At this point, Realm did not have SwiftUI property wrappers, so business-logic was stored in ObservableObjects and the models used Objective-C dynamic variables.

Versions 0.2 to 0.4 moved towards completeness and reusability.
