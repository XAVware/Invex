# InveX

## Overview

InveX was originally intended to replace the concession-tracking app that my parents used at their business. The numerous iterations over the years can be seen in the branches.

Recently my focus has been on solidifying the foundation with clean, readable, and modular code.

The views dynamically adjust to ensure they are layed out effectively on all devices - this is most easily seen on the Make a Sale (POSView.swift) page.

Local Realm data persistence means users don't need to be concerned about sharing data, but this layer could be easily swapped to something like Google Firebase with my [FireImp Project](https://github.com/XAVware/FireImp).
